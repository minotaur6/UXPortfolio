                    <div class="h-50"></div>
                   <p>I have been using Instagram since 2016 and have been a regular user since. The idea of telling your story through pictures was very interesting and exciting and hence this is the reason why I chose to study this platform and try to apply my design knowledge to really push my creative and research abilities.</p>
                   
                   <p>I would however like to point out that the views from this study are strictly my own. I do not have full access to the user data that designers at Instagram worked with to make the application as it currently is. </p>
                    
                   <div class="h-50"></div>

                   <h2>Main objective</h2>
                    </br>
               
                   <p>My main goals of conducting this case study were</p>
                   
                   <ol>
                    <li>To produce a more seamless experience when using the app</li>
                    <li>To design it with respect to a user’s needs, wants and objectives</li>
                    <li>To design a more aesthetic and intuitive UI.</li>
                   </ol>

                <p>The roles I played from the beginning till the end of this case study</p>
                   
                   <ul>
                    <li>User Researcher</li>
                    <li>Data Analyst</li>
                    <li>UI/UX Designer</li>
                    <li>Product Designer</li>
                </ul>

                <p>My personal goals from this study are to learn the research methodology, create wireframes, sketches, and learn how to prototype through Figma.</p>

                <h2>The research and user data</h2>
                            </br>
                <p>I collected user data by talking to 10 Instagram users. It helped me in gathering information and user story about the audience I was designing for which helped me in building personas and the design idealogy. Because of the pandemic, I was unable to conduct all the interviews in person, so some of them were conducted in person and some through a video call.</p>
                <p>The demographics of the interviewed audience included 5 women from ages of 16-25 years old and 5 men from ages of 18-27 years old. 70% are currently either university students or have graduated and are working in their pursued industry.</p>
                <p>I picked the age ranges to be amongst teenagers and young adults <a href="https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/divisions/communications-division/digital-communications-team/assets/documents/guides/A-Guide-To-Social-Media-Platforms-and-Demographics.pdf">since 90% of Instagram’s users are younger than 35 years</a>. 
                    As of March 2019 Pakistan has a total of 5,199,000 users of which <a href="https://napoleoncat.com/stats/instagram-users-in-pakistan/2019/03#:~:text=There%20were%205%20199%20000,group%20(2%20560%20000).">81.7% fall under the age range of 18-34. </a> </p>

                <p>Furthermore 90% of the users rated Instagram as their most used and enjoyable application with 80% of them using it every day for an average of 1.5 hours.</p>
                <p>I asked the interviewees what feature they used the most from the application and why. </p>

                    <br />
                    <p>The feedback I got is seen in the chart above and the top reasons for why they love to use it was because </p>
                   
                    <ol>
                        <li>It’s very easy to use</li>
                        <li>Helps them keep a track of their friend’s lives</li>

                    <h2>Instagram's Current Home Page</h2>

                </br>
                <p>Let's quickly take a look at Instagram's current home page as of October 2020.</p>
                    <br />
                    <br /> <img src="img/home1.png" alt="" class="img-responsive" />
                   
                    <br /> <img src="img/home2.png" alt="" class="img-responsive" />
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    <div class="h-50"></div>










                <h2>Problem #1: Too much happening</h2>
                 </br>
                    <p>When you open the application the first two features that you see are the stories and the feed that you can scroll through. Both are very content saturated and can sometimes feel overwhelming. According to the research on <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/barry_schwartz_the_paradox_of_choice/up-next">“paradox of choices”, </a>more choices can lead to decision fatigue, fear of missing out and less happiness considering the fact that most people check their Instagram as soon as they wake up.
                        Also another fact was that when a person starts scrolling through the feed the story bar disappears from the top and once it’s gone, people usually forget about it.
                        </p>
                        <p>When redesigning, I kept the minimalistic monochromatic look of Instagram that they currently have because the logic behind it was amazing. If you wish to read the article it is <a href="https://medium.com/@ianspalter/designing-a-new-look-for-instagram-inspired-by-the-community-84530eb355e3">here.</a></p>

<br/>
                        <h3>Solution</h3>
                        </br>
                        <p>To resolve this I integrated the two directly in the feed.</p>
                        <p>Now the users can see the content on the feed when scrolling and they can also see the story of that user solving the problem of content overloading and the forgotten story.
                            I did not remove the Insta stories but just moved them into the message inbox. I have further discussed my reasons below.</p>

                            <br />
                            <br />
                           
<center>
    <video height=600 width=350 autoplay loop controls>
        <source src="video/1.1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
      </video>
</center>
                            

                              <br />
                            <br />



                <h2>Problem #2: Dude, all you post is stories of your hand and steering wheel! </h2>

                <br/>

                <p>Surprisingly, when I was conducting the interviews, 7 out of 10 people told me they get annoyed from irrelevant pages they subscribed only for memes, posting ads on their stories or people posting snap after snap of a black screen with a song or just a dude driving his car and all we see is an endlees loop of a steering wheel. Yikes!. They said it really ruined the experience of watching stories.</p>
                <p>This lead me to realize that people were unable to watch content from the people thst mattered.</p>
<br/>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<br/>
                <p>I moved the stories from the main feed to the direct message inbox. It’s more convenient that way because when you reply to a story or send a photo, it goes into their inbox so why not group the message and the stories together?
                </p>
                <p>I also introduced a "Stories from your faves". This would only show stories of your accounts who's story you really want to see. </p>
                <p>In my design, people whom you have not marked as "fav", their stories can be seen from the right side of the screen. </p>

    <video height=600 width=350 autoplay loop controls>
    <source src="video/4.1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    </center>
    <br/><br/>



                <h2>Problem #3: Long distance relationships are hard </h2>
                </br>
                <p>It has been proven through research that the most difficult area to reach your phone’s screen is the top left part. Research also says that the most easiest and convenient way is the bottom right part of the screen. So why not get rid of the problem?</p>
                </br>
                <h3>Solution</h3>
                 </br>

                <p>I redesigned the screen in such a way that you do not have to reach all the way to the top left of your screen to post a story (people with small hands and large phones, I got you bro). Now you can press the middle icon and choose between posting a picture on your feed or story. </p>
                <p>From the data I collected, 100% of the people interviewed know how to post to their feed (because they use it). However 40% of those same people either don’t know how to post to their story or just don’t use it at all. The redesign helps to make it more easier to see and use. </p>

<video height=600 width=350 autoplay loop controls>
<source src="video/2.1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
</center>
                

                  <br />
                <br />

                <h2>Problem #4: Lost in the sea </h2>
            </br>

                        <p>Sometimes replying to comments can be very daunting when you have your notifications flooded with comments and you have to click to and fro from notification page to your post.</p>
            <p>I asked the interviewees to explain me the process of replying to the sea of comments coming up on a newly posted photo. Out of 10, 7 of them said that they have gotten lost in either replying to someone, or searching up a particular comment. </p>

                </br>
                <h3>Solution</h3>
                </br>

                <p>I thought it would be easier if the user was able to reply to comments directly from the notifications page by holding onto the person’s comment, once you hold it, it will trigger a comment box to appear where you can type in the reply and post it.</p>

                <h2>What I learned from this study</h2>
                            </br>


<p>Taking on this challenge as a very beginner in designing was the best decision I made. I was familiar with coding and the challenges it poses. Learning about design strategies really helped me reflect in my coding skills too. </p>
<p>I outlined a general idea when I started the project about what things I will be able to learn once I complete it, that general outline grew into a whole chapter of new things, skills, strategies, workflows, ideas, platforms and so much more that I got to experience.
    I learned random things, small things that I never paid attention to. I learned how to curate my own way, how to make decisions and how to not get stuck to a single design because design is an iterative process and what I started with evolved into something else.  
    </p>
